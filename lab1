              (default): mtime, modification; birth time: birth, creation;

              with -l, WORD determines which time to show; with --sort=time, sort by WORD (newest first)

       --time-style=TIME_STYLE
              time/date format with -l; see TIME_STYLE below

       -T, --tabsize=COLS
              assume tab stops at each COLS instead of 8

       -u     with -lt: sort by, and show, access time; with -l: show access time and sort by name; otherwise: sort by access time, newest first

       -U     do not sort; list entries in directory order

       -v     natural sort of (version) numbers within text

       -w, --width=COLS
              set output width to COLS.  0 means no limit

       -X     sort alphabetically by entry extension

       -Z, --context
              print any security context of each file

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The SIZE argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K is 10*1024).  Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y,R,Q (powers of 1024) or KB,MB,... (powers  of
       1000).  Binary prefixes can be used, too: KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.

       The  TIME_STYLE  argument  can  be  full-iso,  long-iso,  iso, locale, or +FORMAT.  FORMAT is interpreted like in date(1).  If FORMAT is FORMAT1<new‐
       line>FORMAT2, then FORMAT1 applies to non-recent files and FORMAT2 to recent files.  TIME_STYLE prefixed with 'posix-' takes effect only outside  the
       POSIX locale.  Also the TIME_STYLE environment variable sets the default style to use.

       The WHEN argument defaults to 'always' and can also be 'auto' or 'never'.

       Using color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and with --color=never.  With --color=auto, ls emits color codes only when standard
       output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment variable can change the settings.  Use the dircolors(1) command to set it.

   Exit status:
       0      if OK,

       1      if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),

       2      if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).

TOUCH(1)                                                                User Commands                                                               TOUCH(1)

NAME
       touch - change file timestamps

SYNOPSIS
       touch [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Update the access and modification times of each FILE to the current time.

       A FILE argument that does not exist is created empty, unless -c or -h is supplied.

       A FILE argument string of - is handled specially and causes touch to change the times of the file associated with standard output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a     change only the access time

       -c, --no-create
              do not create any files

       -d, --date=STRING
              parse STRING and use it instead of current time

       -f     (ignored)

       -h, --no-dereference
              affect each symbolic link instead of any referenced file (useful only on systems that can change the timestamps of a symlink)

       -m     change only the modification time

       -r, --reference=FILE
              use this file's times instead of current time

       -t STAMP
              use [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss] instead of current time

       --time=WORD
              change the specified time: WORD is access, atime, or use: equivalent to -a WORD is modify or mtime: equivalent to -m

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Note that the -d and -t options accept different time-date formats.

DATE STRING
       The --date=STRING is a mostly free format human readable date string such as "Sun, 29 Feb 2004 16:21:42 -0800" or "2004-02-29 16:21:42" or even "next
       Thursday".  A date string may contain items indicating calendar date, time of day, time zone, day of week, relative time, relative date, and numbers.
       An  empty string indicates the beginning of the day.  The date string format is more complex than is easily documented here but is fully described in
       the info documentation.

NAME
       mv - move (rename) files

SYNOPSIS
       mv [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
       mv [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
       mv [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...

DESCRIPTION
       Rename SOURCE to DEST, or move SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       --backup[=CONTROL]
              make a backup of each existing destination file

       -b     like --backup but does not accept an argument

       --debug
              explain how a file is copied.  Implies -v

       -f, --force
              do not prompt before overwriting

       -i, --interactive
              prompt before overwrite

       -n, --no-clobber
              do not overwrite an existing file

       If you specify more than one of -i, -f, -n, only the final one takes effect.

       --no-copy
              do not copy if renaming fails

       --strip-trailing-slashes
              remove any trailing slashes from each SOURCE argument

       -S, --suffix=SUFFIX
              override the usual backup suffix

       -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
              move all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY

       -T, --no-target-directory
              treat DEST as a normal file

       --update[=UPDATE]
              control which existing files are updated; UPDATE={all,none,older(default)}.  See below

       -u     equivalent to --update[=older]

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done

       -Z, --context
              set SELinux security context of destination file to default type

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       UPDATE  controls  which existing files in the destination are replaced.  'all' is the default operation when an --update option is not specified, and
       results in all existing files in the destination being replaced.  'none' is similar to the --no-clobber option, in that no files in  the  destination
       are  replaced, but also skipped files do not induce a failure.  'older' is the default operation when --update is specified, and results in files be‐
       ing replaced if they're older than the corresponding source file.

       The backup suffix is '~', unless set with --suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The version control method may be selected via the  --backup  option  or
       through the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if --backup is given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise

       simple, never

NAME
       cp - copy files and directories

SYNOPSIS
       cp [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
       cp [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
       cp [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...

DESCRIPTION
       Copy SOURCE to DEST, or multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --archive
              same as -dR --preserve=all

       --attributes-only
              don't copy the file data, just the attributes

       --backup[=CONTROL]
              make a backup of each existing destination file

       -b     like --backup but does not accept an argument

       --copy-contents
              copy contents of special files when recursive

       -d     same as --no-dereference --preserve=links

       --debug
              explain how a file is copied.  Implies -v

       -f, --force
              if an existing destination file cannot be opened, remove it and try again (this option is ignored when the -n option is also used)

       -i, --interactive
              prompt before overwrite (overrides a previous -n option)

       -H     follow command-line symbolic links in SOURCE

       -l, --link
              hard link files instead of copying

       -L, --dereference
              always follow symbolic links in SOURCE

       -n, --no-clobber
              do not overwrite an existing file (overrides a -u or previous -i option). See also --update

       -P, --no-dereference
              never follow symbolic links in SOURCE

       -p     same as --preserve=mode,ownership,timestamps

       --preserve[=ATTR_LIST]
              preserve the specified attributes

       --no-preserve=ATTR_LIST
              don't preserve the specified attributes

       --parents
              use full source file name under DIRECTORY

       -R, -r, --recursive
              copy directories recursively

       --reflink[=WHEN]
              control clone/CoW copies. See below

       --remove-destination
              remove each existing destination file before attempting to open it (contrast with --force)

       --sparse=WHEN
              control creation of sparse files. See below

       --strip-trailing-slashes
              remove any trailing slashes from each SOURCE argument

       -s, --symbolic-link
              make symbolic links instead of copying

       -S, --suffix=SUFFIX
              override the usual backup suffix

       -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
              copy all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY

       -T, --no-target-directory
              treat DEST as a normal file

       --update[=UPDATE]
              control which existing files are updated; UPDATE={all,none,older(default)}.  See below

       -u     equivalent to --update[=older]

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done

       -x, --one-file-system
              stay on this file system

       -Z     set SELinux security context of destination file to default type

       --context[=CTX]
              like -Z, or if CTX is specified then set the SELinux or SMACK security context to CTX

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       ATTR_LIST  is  a comma-separated list of attributes. Attributes are 'mode' for permissions (including any ACL and xattr permissions), 'ownership' for
       user and group, 'timestamps' for file timestamps, 'links' for hard links, 'context' for security context, 'xattr' for extended attributes, and  'all'
       for all attributes.

       By  default,  sparse SOURCE files are detected by a crude heuristic and the corresponding DEST file is made sparse as well.  That is the behavior se‐
       lected by --sparse=auto.  Specify --sparse=always to create a sparse DEST file whenever the SOURCE file contains  a  long  enough  sequence  of  zero
       bytes.  Use --sparse=never to inhibit creation of sparse files.

       UPDATE  controls  which existing files in the destination are replaced.  'all' is the default operation when an --update option is not specified, and
       results in all existing files in the destination being replaced.  'none' is similar to the --no-clobber option, in that no files in  the  destination
       are  replaced, but also skipped files do not induce a failure.  'older' is the default operation when --update is specified, and results in files be‐
       ing replaced if they're older than the corresponding source file.

       When --reflink[=always] is specified, perform a lightweight copy, where the data blocks are copied only when modified.  If this is not  possible  the
       copy fails, or if --reflink=auto is specified, fall back to a standard copy.  Use --reflink=never to ensure a standard copy is performed.

       The  backup  suffix  is '~', unless set with --suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The version control method may be selected via the --backup option or
       through the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if --backup is given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups

       As a special case, cp makes a backup of SOURCE when the force and backup options are given and SOURCE and DEST are the same  name  for  an  existing,
       regular file.
